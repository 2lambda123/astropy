Overview
========

Astropy 5.1 is a major release that adds significant new functionality since
the 5.0 LTS release.

In particular, this release includes:

* :ref:`whatsnew-5.0-cosmology`
* :ref:`whatsnew-doppler-redshift-eq`

.. _whatsnew-5.0-cosmology:

Updates to ``Cosmology``
========================

:class:`~astropy.cosmology.Cosmology` is now an abstract base class,
and subclasses must override the abstract property ``is_flat``.
For :class:`~astropy.cosmology.FLRW`, ``is_flat`` checks that ``Ok0=0`` and
``Omtot0=1``.

.. _whatsnew-doppler-redshift-eq:

``doppler_redshift`` equivalency
================================

New :func:`astropy.units.equivalencies.doppler_redshift` is added to
provide conversion between Doppler redshift and radial velocity.
