Astropy 5.2 is a major release that adds significant new functionality since

In particular, this release includes:


.. _whatsnew-quantity-dtype:

``Quantity`` data types
=======================

The default dtype argument for ``Quantity`` has been changed, so that one can
now explicitly give ``dtype=None`` to get the same behaviour as :mod:`numpy`.
Without an explicit argument, any integer values are still upcast to floating
point, since that makes more sense for physical quantities.
