Add a "fraction" and "inline" options to all the unit ``format`` classes,
which determine whether, if a unit has bases raised to a negative power,
a string representation should just show the negative powers (``fraction=False``)
or use a fraction, and, in the latter case, whether to use a
single-line representation using a solidus (``inline=True``) or, if
the format supports it, a multi-line presentation with the numerator
and denominator separated by a horizontal line (``inline=False``).
