Fixed a bug where instantiating a coordinate representation without copying the
component inputs would return a representation whose components were always
broadcasted versions, even for those components that did not need to change
shape.  Broadcasted versions can have more restrictions on writeability than
the original inputs, and is particularly problematic when changing the wrap
angle on longitude components.
