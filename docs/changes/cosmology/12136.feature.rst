Flat cosmologies are now set by a mixin class, ``FlatCosmologyMixin`` and its
FLRW-specific subclass ``FlatFLRWMixin``. All ``FlatCosmologyMixin`` are flat,
but not all flat cosmologies are instances of ``FlatCosmologyMixin``. As
example, ``LambdaCDM`` **may** be flat (for the a specific set of parameter
values),  but ``FlatLambdaCDM`` **will** be flat.
