Adds the :class:`~astropy.timeseries.LombScargleMultiband` class, which is an
extension of the :class:`~astropy.timeseries.LombScargle` class. It enables the
generation of periodograms for datasets with measurements taken in more than
one photometric band.

The code is adapted from the `astroml`_ package and the
`gatspy`_ package, but conforms closely to the design paradigms
established in :class:`~astropy.timeseries.LombScargle`.

Two implementations of the Multiband Lomb-Scargle Periodogram are available
within :class:`~astropy.timeseries.LombScargleMultiband`, ``gatspy`` and
``fast``. ``gatspy`` is a direct port of the LombScargleMultiband algorithm
used in the gatspy `gatspy`_ package. ``fast`` serves as a similar
implementation to ``gatspy`` LombScargleMultibandFast, but leverages
:class:`~astropy.timeseries.LombScargle` to do its independent band-by-band
fits.
