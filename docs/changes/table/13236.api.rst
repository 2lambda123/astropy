Changed behavior when a structured ``numpy.ndarray`` is added as a column to a
``Table``. Previously this was converted to a ``NdarrayMixin`` subclass of
``ndarray`` and added as a mixin column. This was because saving as a file (e.g.
HDF5, FITS, ECSV) was not supported for structured array columns. Now a
structured ``numpy.ndarray`` is added to the table as a native ``Column`` and
saving to file is supported.
