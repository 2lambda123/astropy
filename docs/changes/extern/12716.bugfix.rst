Local CSS file `jquery.dataTables.css` refers to several images called
`sort*.png`. They are the little arrows next to each sortable column. These
images exist at the CDN (https://cdn.datatables.net/1.10.12/images/), but they
were missing in this repo. Images required to display the corresponding arrows
were added.
