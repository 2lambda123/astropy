The ``as_image_hdu`` option is now available for ``CCDData.to_hdu``. This option
allows the user to get an ``ImageHDU`` as the first item of the returned
``HDUList``, instead of the default ``PrimaryHDU``. Before this feature, there
was no trivial way to get an ``ImageHDU`` from a ``CCDData`` object.
