Fixed a bug due to which ``naxis``, ``pixel_shape``, and
``pixel_bounds`` attributes of ``astropy.wcs.WCS`` were not restored when
an ``astropy.wcs.WCS`` object was unpickled. This fix also eliminates
``FITSFixedWarning`` warning issued during unpiclikng of the WCS objects
related to the number of axes.
